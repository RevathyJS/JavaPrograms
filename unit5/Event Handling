Event Handling
-> Event => action
-> Event Source => component
-> Event handled => program

Steps
1. Listener[Mouse,MouseMotion,Key,Window]  => Interface
2. add listener
3. Implement all methods

MouseListener
-> public void mouseClicked(MouseEvent me) { }
-> public void mousePressed(MouseEvent me) { }
-> public void mouseReleased(MouseEvent me) { }
-> public void mouseEntered(MouseEvent me) { }
-> public void mouseExited(MouseEvent me) { }

MouseMotionListener
-> public void mouseDragged(MouseEvent me) { }
-> public void mouseMoved(MouseEvent me) { }

KeyListener
-> public void keyTyped(KeyEvent me) { }
-> public void keyPressed(KeyEvent me) { }
-> public void keyReleased(KeyEvent me) { }

WindowListener
-> public void windowActivated(WindowEvent we){}
-> public void windowClosed(WindowEvent we){}  
-> public void windowClosing(WindowEvent we){}  
-> public void windowDeactivated(WindowEvent we){}  
-> public void windowDeiconified(WindowEvent we){}  
-> public void windowIconified(WindowEvent we){}  
-> public void windowOpened(WindowEvent we){}
